- **Copy Functionality**: One-click JSON data copying for development use

<br>

## Getting Started

Clone the repository: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/puter-apps/puter-app-data-inspector.git
```

and open the `index.html` file in any hosted environment.

Alternatively, access the hosted version at [https://puter.com/app/app-inspector](https://puter.com/app/app-inspector)

## How It Works

App Data Inspector leverages [**Puter.js**](https://developer.puter.com/) to provide developer insights:

1. **Authentication**: Uses Puter's authentication system to securely access user app data

2. **App Discovery**: Retrieves the complete list of applications in the user's account

3. **Data Extraction**: Pulls the full metadata structure for each application

4. **Visual Rendering**: Presents complex JSON data with syntax highlighting and visual organization
